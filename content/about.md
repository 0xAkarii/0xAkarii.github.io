Hi, my name is Alva Radian, you can call me Alva or Radian. I love computers since I was a kid. I started learning about cybersecurity in 2019. I learned about penetration testing especially on a website application, and from 2019 - the present I was doing bug bounty and some project penetration testing on website applications.

I’m not a professional penetration tester as you think. There are still more that I have to learn about cybersecurity especially penetration testing on Android, iOS, and other application. I love other tech stuff too like programming, networking, etc.

My hobbies are listening to music, I like hip-hop music. Sometimes I playing a game, my favorite game is FPS game such as Valorant, Apex Legends, etc. Also I like watching movies and anime. My favorite genre are mystery, action, psychological, romance :D
