      <description>Hi, my name is Alva Radian, you can call me Alva or Radian. I love computers since I was a kid. I started learning about cybersecurity in 2019. I learned about penetration testing especially on a website application, and from 2019 - the present I was doing bug bounty and some project penetration testing on website applications.
Iâ€™m not a professional penetration tester as you think. There are still more that I have to learn about cybersecurity especially penetration testing on Android, iOS, and other application.</description>
